      <description>I love brass. Brass is a hard metal that will outlast me. It is strange to think about things that will exist after we are gone. I own a Kaweco pen that is brass. Assuming I buy ink refills, I never have to buy a pen again.
That is a single example that explains the idea behind this article. What thing can you acquire once, and then never have to buy a newer version again?</description>
