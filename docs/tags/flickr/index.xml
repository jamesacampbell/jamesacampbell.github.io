      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve complained about Flickr&amp;rsquo;s new redesign enough. There are some positives about the service that still out-do any other online photo sharing website.
For example, I am one of the lucky ones who have been grandfathered into Flickr&amp;rsquo;s unlimited photo plan when my Pro plan was renewed earlier this year. This means that for $25 per year I get unlimited photo storage.
This fact, coupled with the auto-upload feature in the Flickr app for the iPhone means I have everything I need to backup and store all of my photos taken on my iPhone.</description>
