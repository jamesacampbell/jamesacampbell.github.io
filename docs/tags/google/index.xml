      <description>I used to love Google services and their policy of &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t be evil.&amp;rdquo; The anagram solver tells me that the phrase turns into the word &amp;lsquo;violented.&amp;rsquo; Well I definitely feel whatever that means.
I was a huge fan of Google Reader and Google Analytics. I even setup and managed google analytic accounts for websites that I created for clients. Not today.
I do understand it is probably cliche in the ever-growing hipster-tech community to be anti-google but I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have my digital life attached to a single service where I am the product, which is also the reason I have a largely vacant Facebook account.</description>
