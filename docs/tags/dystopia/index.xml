      <description>In 2013, we looked pretty ridiculous standing around staring at our phones, tablets, phablets, and iPads.
My goal in this post is to share photos I have curated that document the phenomenon of humans interacting with new technology.
Since I believe I am a better curator than writer, I will try to keep the words to a minimum.
New technology is great, but we need to figure out what it means and how it fits into our lives.</description>
