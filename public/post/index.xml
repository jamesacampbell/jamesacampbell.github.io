      <title>Streaming Music From The Terminal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you remember Rdio? It was a better than Spotify at streaming music back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Entertainment Weekly compared a number of music services and judged Rdio the best, grading it &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; and writing that it had &amp;ldquo;by far the best app and online interface, making database searching and playlist curation easy&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20663844,00.html&#34; title=&#34;The best, but filed for bankruptcy.&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rdio ended up not finding the right business model, or spending too much of its 200 million, or who knows what, but it filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and Pandora purchased it and all of its assets for 75 million cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and I still use Pandora (I also am on &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/user/jamesanthonycampbell&#34; title=&#34;Yep, I am a hipster.&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me about Pandora is that there is no desktop client. I guess they focus on mobile and web? Or is there a workaround?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://6xq.net/pianobar/&#34; title=&#34;I was hesitant to link to it, I don&#39;t want it to get too popular.&#34;&gt;Pianobar&lt;/a&gt;. A thoughtful command line client for Pandora. Here is what mine looks like when I initialize it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
$ pianobar
Welcome to pianobar (2018.06.22)! Press ? for a list of commands.
(i) Login... Ok.
(i) Get stations... Ok.
|&gt;  Station &#34;Sunset Rubdown Radio&#34; (54342580605901210)
(i) Receiving new playlist... Ok.
|&gt;  &#34;You Go On Ahead (Trumpet Trumpet II)&#34; by &#34;Sunset Rubdown&#34; on &#34;Dragonslayer&#34; &lt;3
#   -05:41/05:45
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It auto loads the previous station you were listening to, in my case it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Rubdown&#34; title=&#34;Was a great Canadian indie rock band that included piano hero Spencer Krug.&#34;&gt;Sunset Rubdown&lt;/a&gt; Radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out if you are on a Mac, and have &lt;a href=&#34;https:/brew.sh&#34; title=&#34;homebrew is a great package manager, and works on windows and linux now too.&#34;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; installed, you can do &lt;code&gt;brew install pianobar&lt;/code&gt; and you can access and stream music from the terminal, complete with keyboard shortcuts to change stations and thumb-up (&lt;code&gt;shift + =&lt;/code&gt;) or thumb-down (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;) tracks. The &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; gets you the list of all of the commands. For completeness here ya go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    +    love song
    -    ban song
    a    add music to station
    c    create new station
    d    delete station
    e    explain why this song is played
    g    add genre station
    h    song history
    i    print information about song/station
    j    add shared station
    n    next song
    p    pause/resume playback
    q    quit
    r    rename station
    s    change station
    t    tired (ban song for 1 month)
    u    upcoming songs
    x    select quickmix stations
    b    bookmark song/artist
    (    decrease volume
    )    increase volume
    =    delete seeds/feedback
    v    create new station from song or artist
    P    resume playback
    S    pause playback
    ^    reset volume
    !    change settings
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a step further, you can create a config file at &lt;code&gt;~/.config/pianobar/config&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;mkdir -p ~/.config/pianobar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nano ~/.config/pianobar/config&lt;/code&gt; that will auto-log you into your Pandora account and even autostream a particular station of interest if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example config from &lt;code&gt;man pianobar&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
audio_quality = high
autostart_station = 2

password = plaintext_password
user = your@user.name
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the headless apps I use every day, so I thought I would share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What apps are indispensible to you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forever Things</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Forever-Things/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love brass. Brass is a hard metal that will outlast me. It is strange to think about things that will exist after we are gone. I own a Kaweco pen that is brass. Assuming I buy ink refills, I never have to buy a pen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a single example that explains the idea behind this article. What thing can you acquire once, and then never have to buy a newer version again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came up with a list of 10 things that, if you make the right choice when purchasing, you should never have to buy again for your entire life. You may have to repair or buy parts for them, but you will never have to buy the full item again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toothbrush. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZN5ATQ/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_MZVEDbAZDF0ZZ&#34; title=&#34;Best toothbrush available&#34;&gt;same electric toothbrush&lt;/a&gt; for 10 years. No, that is not disgusting! I buy different heads for it periodically, but the charger still works really well, and I have no plans to buy anything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallet. I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/daily-carry-leather-notebook-cover&#34; title=&#34;Nice patina and gets better over time&#34;&gt;Field Notes Leather wallet&lt;/a&gt; that holds my notebook, pen, passport, and credit cards. It will definitely outlast me. Update: I procured a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZH8YK4/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_GFmTDb7YYCNKC&#34; title=&#34;This is not the exact one but similar&#34;&gt;brass cigarette case&lt;/a&gt; that I am now using as a wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage Trunk. Still searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backpack. Still searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitcase. Still searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefcase. &lt;a href=&#34;http://a.co/22VWxxd&#34; title=&#34;100 years.&#34;&gt;Saddleback Leather Front Pocket Briefcase&lt;/a&gt; 100 year warranty!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boots. Still searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoes. Spend $200 to $700 on a nice pair of shoes and just re-sole them. You will never have to worry about shoes ever again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pens. I have this &lt;a href=&#34;http://a.co/5P0KU90&#34; title=&#34;Best pen in the world.&#34;&gt;Kaweco Sport Pocket Pen&lt;/a&gt;. I never have to buy another again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch. Still searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>On Photography and Joy</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/on-photography-and-joy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/on-photography-and-joy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Begin, What Do I Call Myself Online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with doing many things is that I have trouble filling in my bio information on social networking sites. Do I say &amp;lsquo;photographer&amp;rsquo; even though it is not my day job? Do I say &amp;lsquo;web developer&amp;rsquo; even though a lot of the times I am just solving issues for clients and not actually coding? Do I say founder of InstantDC.com and curator of photo exhibitions, even though this is usually once or twice a year? Do I say musician and one-man-band GoldForLions, with singles on iTunes even though I have made about $11 total from all of my efforts? Do I try to say something clever in my profile and avoid the issue of labels altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no easy solution, but at 32 years old, I know myself and what I love to do. I love my wife and my four-month-old son. I love to tinker with things, I love to solve problems in creative ways (strange phrase - as opposed to non-creative ways?). I love to create art with technology and showcase technology with art. I love playing guitar and creating music. I enjoy the instant gratification of changing a stylesheet and seeing a webpage change when I hit Command+R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the guide to what drives me is this simple statement: what brings me joy is also what challenges me. And also: what brings me joy allows me to challenge myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was I excited about having the opportunity to manage a photo exhibit at FotoweekDC last year? Yes. Did it turn out exactly the way I planned? No. But I am glad I did it because it was very challenging to manage 12 different photography groups and volunteers for an entire week. I learned a lot about what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when putting on a large-scale photography exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every time I push myself to do something new, I learn new things, meet new people, and gain perspective. This is a positive feedback loop that I use to gain confidence in each new endeavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography and Developing Your Visual Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bear with me as I try to explain what is very hard to put into words: the experience of taking and viewing a photograph.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photography is an amalgamation of technology, art, and magic. I am eager to go where it takes me. There is always something strange to see around the next corner. Even that same corner at a different time of day or season can be another planet. Every time my eye finds the viewfinder, that rectangular scene is looking back at me. Sometimes the scene mocks me. Sometimes it beckons me. Sometimes it is laughing in the dust. Becoming better at the craft of photography is building a working relationship with what is through the looking-glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visual intelligence is being trained over time into a new vocabulary made up of colors, shapes, and light. This visual language is pictographic and temporal. A blue square of chipped paint and an organic green pine tree are connected via a gray sky and crooked sidewalk. But tomorrow the chipped paint is fixed, the pine tree is cut, and the sky is now blue. The sidewalk is also fixed. Did the scene change or did the viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective in time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go further into the challenges of viewing a photo, sometimes a word destroys an entire photographic experience. I stopped titling my photos because I was framing too much for the viewer. If I titled something &amp;ldquo;Wall on 30th Street&amp;rdquo; you would be prepared for a wall, but maybe without the title you would have interpreted the scene as a very flat puppy? I stopped writing captions for the same reasons. Words ruin photographs. I am a firm believer in training yourself to see over time in your own way and to avoid words at all costs. My favorite photographers are the ones who are taciturn as they go about their craft. This does not necessarily require them to be introverted, but when they are in the mode of taking photographs, they are creating and cultivating a louder silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you build up your visual vocabulary, you will recognize in other&amp;rsquo;s photographs attempts to solve similar riddles. Patterns develop overtime as one photographer is influenced by another and you will see how genres of street photos, portrait, and landscape photos evolve. Each decision you make with a photograph does not need explanation. The viewer will either understand or not, or interpret it differently based on their own experiences and own personal vocabularies that they have build up over time according to their place and experience in their own societal bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best things about our new picture-taking culture. The societal bubbles are popping. The internet allows you to self-select and curate, but it also allows you to discover something new. It is true that we are being over-saturated with millions of images per day. This, to me, sounds like a problem of lack of curation, something that technology may help solve. The positives to this drowning in images is that we are all building up a strong visual intelligence as both observer and creators of images as we sink slowly to the bottom of this sweet abyss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, to get to whether or not to call myself a photographer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew, that was long-winded but I am leaving it as is. Onward:
I waffle back and forth between stating that I am a photographer in my profiles. The issue here is what it means to be a photographer. Here is how I define it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, photography is a need. It is a requirement for happiness. It is searching for visual puzzles to solve. It is pushing the mind to the edges of what reality can be into a super-reality of shapes, colors, light and dark. It is the shocking feeling of the banal. It is the juxtaposition of what we have done to the world and what the world has done to us. It is the opportunity to stop time. It is my passion and my art and it continues to surprise me. I define a successful photograph on my own terms and I am my own harshest critic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My four month old son and my wife bring me so much happiness and have changed me in so many ways I cannot express it in words, but at my core being I still have this need to create things and this will never go away. It is who I am, it is part of my being. It goes beyond ambition, greed, etc. With less free time nowadays, I rely on photography even more to fill this need and I cannot wait to see where this desire takes me next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and attempting to understand why I call myself a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2013 The Year We Missed</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/The-Year-We-Missed/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2013 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/The-Year-We-Missed/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we looked pretty ridiculous standing around staring at our phones, tablets, phablets, and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in this post is to share photos I have curated that document the phenomenon of humans interacting with new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I believe I am a better curator than writer, I will try to keep the words to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7049846391_fd4cc6cb7c_b_d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;man on phone&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New technology is great, but we need to figure out what it means and how it fits into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were our lives more meaningful and rich when we were analog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do today to enable meaning in a world that expresses emotion through a like button?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&#39;protected&#39; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3607/3564918558_7605a5930a_b_d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;pcaption&#34;&gt;photo credit Ed Yourdon&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of hipster culture is an indication of our collective nostalgia for what we did before the cloud came along that digitized, monetized, and made available everything we want at a moments notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have a rule: &lt;em&gt;no phones out at meals&lt;/em&gt;. It is simple, but it really works. What other rules make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 is the year we start finding smart uses for our technology that enable human connection, interaction, and sharing, as opposed to keeping us apart even when we are in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;happy-new-year:b0ff82f7954f4046a2465a5e1b65d296&#34;&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Why Flickr is My Online Backup Solution</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Why-Flickr-is-My-Online-Backup-Solution/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Why-Flickr-is-My-Online-Backup-Solution/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve complained about Flickr&amp;rsquo;s new redesign enough. There are some positives about the service that still out-do any other online photo sharing website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I am one of the lucky ones who have been grandfathered into Flickr&amp;rsquo;s unlimited photo plan when my Pro plan was renewed earlier this year. This means that for $25 per year I get &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; photo storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.jamescampbell.us/img/flickr-backup.png&#34; alt=&#34;screenshot of flickr unlimited available&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact, coupled with the auto-upload feature in the Flickr app for the iPhone means I have everything I need to backup and store all of my photos taken on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I tested this system and used it for the last week, I turned off Photo Stream on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated workflow on iPhone is as follows:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a photo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next time I open the Flickr app, all of my photos are there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All done. I can download again, edit, publish anytime I wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos are automatically set as private until I decide to publish. That is it. No messing with sending to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dropbox.com&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.loom.com&#34;&gt;Loom&lt;/a&gt;, Everpix (now defunct), or trying to rely on the 1000 photo limit of Photo Stream to force me to get to the photos before they disappear into the aether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to use something other than Flickr, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.loom.com&#34;&gt;Loom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From their website:
&amp;gt; Loom is a place for all your photos and videos.
&amp;gt; One library, seamlessly organized and accessible from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said on twitter, Loom is what Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4486&#34;&gt;My Photo Stream&lt;/a&gt; should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loom is what photo stream should be. I reserved a spot for it. Still, Apple needs to fix photo stream. &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/brORHoRWV4&#34;&gt;http://t.co/brORHoRWV4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; James Campbell (@jamescampbell) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jamescampbell/statuses/360091206304272384&#34;&gt;July 24, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>My Daily News Routine</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/My-Daily-News-Routine/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2013 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/My-Daily-News-Routine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for anyone to keep up with everything that happens every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, stuck between Youtube videos, tweets, Flickr contacts, etcetera, I realized this. I decided to filter out what I really needed daily through a tight collection of RSS feeds and email subscriptions. I started with an initial list of 10 to 20 in Google Reader and it grew from there. I will skip the growing pains of this method, but trust me, it was hard to find a happy medium between being overwhelmed with content and feeling informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the present day and I have over 400 RSS feeds residing on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feedafever.com&#34;&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt; in over 20 different folder categories, the main being &lt;em&gt;photography&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;art and design&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;coding&lt;/em&gt;. I also have one folder labeled &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; where I have a select few including Seth Godin&amp;rsquo;s blog. I will save the full list of my RSS for another post. The rest of this post will focus on what I read via email every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My email subscriptions are even more pared down than my RSS. Here is my daily reading schedule (when the emails hit my inbox):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6am&lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;a href=&#34;http://thebrief.io/&#34;&gt;The Brief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brief is &amp;ldquo;Today in technology, updated once a day&amp;rdquo; that includes great headlines on what the tech press will be talking about throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;630am&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.news.me&#34;&gt;News.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News.me is &amp;ldquo;a small team based out of betaworks in New York City. We build applications that improve the way people find and talk about the news.&amp;rdquo; Their headlines never cross with what The Brief posts, which I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7am&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vimeo is where I find great artists posting videos about their works. The daily email is only new content from contacts I am following on Vimeo (similar to Flickr&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;latest from your contacts&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8am&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newser.com&#34;&gt;Newser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newser is a news aggregator website. I would skip the site completely and just sign-up for their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newser.com/subscriptions.aspx&#34;&gt;email newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;830am&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digg.com&#34;&gt;Daily Digg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digg has done a great pivot into a news-discovery tool from its root as a social news aggregation site. From the site: &amp;ldquo;Digg delivers the most interesting and talked about stories on the Internet right now. The Internet is full of great stories, and Digg helps you find, read, and share the very best ones.&amp;rdquo; Sign up for the Daily Digg by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12pm&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.swayy.co&#34;&gt;SWAYY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swayy is yet another service trying to intelligently recommend content to you based on the content you follow on other social media sites. From the site: &amp;ldquo;Swayy brings you the best content to easily share with your audience and followers, based on their interests and engagement.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/getswayy&#34;&gt;@getswayy&lt;/a&gt; on twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4pm&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nextdraft.com&#34;&gt;NextDraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the site: &amp;ldquo;The day&amp;rsquo;s most fascinating news.&amp;rdquo; Also:
&amp;ldquo;Dave Pell is a first class picker, packer and shipper of the nuggets you need to know. NextDraft will make you love email again.&amp;rdquo; by Michael Sippey, Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NextDraft also has an iPhone app that you can download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. This is what I read every day at a minimum, even when I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for my RSS feeds, I can always open my mail app and read these highlights from the day&amp;rsquo;s news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you keep up? Send me a message on &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://twitter.com/home?status=@jamescampbell article awesome comment http://j1c.co/1dJ9itu&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:james@jamescampbell.us?subject=Hello&#34; title=&#34;Email me&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A List of Google Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/A-List-of-Google-Alternatives/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2013 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/A-List-of-Google-Alternatives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to love Google services and their policy of &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t be evil.&amp;rdquo; The anagram solver tells me that the phrase turns into the word &amp;lsquo;violented.&amp;rsquo; Well I definitely feel whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a huge fan of Google Reader and Google Analytics. I even setup and managed google analytic accounts for websites that I created for clients. Not today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do understand it is probably cliche in the ever-growing hipster-tech community to be anti-google but I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have my digital life attached to a single service where I am the product, which is also the reason I have a largely vacant Facebook account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I have found out there to replace google (I am not getting paid to endorse any of these services, I just love them because they work the same or better than Google&amp;rsquo;s version):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Reader &lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-hand-o-right&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://tt-rss.org/&#34; title=&#34;Nice, easy install and lightweight rss feed manager and reader&#34;&gt;TT-RSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Feedburner &lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-hand-o-right&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://feedpress.it&#34; title=&#34;Highly customizable, mine is running at feed.jamescampbell.us/jamescampbell&#34;&gt;FeedPress&lt;/a&gt; (formerly URI.LV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Gmail &lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-hand-o-right&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mailinabox.email&#34; title=&#34;Yes, you can run your own email server.&#34;&gt;Mail in a Box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive &lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-hand-o-right&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextcloud.com/install&#34; title=&#34;your data your way, bonus points is it comes with Mail in a Box&#34;&gt;NextCloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Docs &lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-hand-o-right&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fengoffice.com/web/professional_vs_community.php&#34; title=&#34;Google docs and calendar and notes&#34;&gt;FengOffice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics &lt;i class=&#39;fa fa-hand-o-right&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess&#34; title=&#34;Nice linux terminal interface in case you dont have web access&#34;&gt;GoAccess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You run TT-RSS, NextCloud, and FengOffice on your own server with your own domain. For instance, I have my tt-rss installation at &lt;a href=&#34;https://jr.jamescampbell.us/tt-rss&#34;&gt;jr.jamescampbell.us/tt-rss&lt;/a&gt;. If you need help setting this up, send me a message via one of my contact methods below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Change Your Inbox Habit</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Change-Your-Inbox-Habit/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2013 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Change-Your-Inbox-Habit/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-email-is-tough-you-need-a-strategy:f39a381078bb4971d82526982b3ecc50&#34;&gt;managing email is tough, you need a strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking email constantly makes you feel like you are getting things done, but in reality it is just another form of procrastination. You probably spend more of your day than you realize on email. That is why my main advice this week is for you to &lt;em&gt;go on an email diet&lt;/em&gt;. Limit your email checking to 2-3 times per day. I find that once in the morning, once at lunch, and once in the evening works fine for me. It was very hard to follow at first, I had to force myself to not look at my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to realize that the world will go on. If people really need to get in touch with you, they should have your phone number or another more real-time method of communication. The nature of email is asynchronous, so use it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rules-of-the-road:f39a381078bb4971d82526982b3ecc50&#34;&gt;rules of the road&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some rules to follow to make this a reality? During your dedicated email times: 1. Open each email exactly once. 2. Deal with each email immediately when you open it. Ask yourself if it requires a response and if the response can be taken care of in the next two minutes. If it requires a response but will take longer, drop it in a &amp;lsquo;later&amp;rsquo; folder to deal with when you have time. If you can respond to it right away, do so. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any response then archive/delete. If it is something that you need to read later or check out later, drop into the appropriate folder/tag and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this process for every single email in your inbox. Once you get to zero you are done. Oh, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to unsubscribe from all unnecessary email lists, like Living Social, Groupon, and other email advertisements. Go about your day and enjoy the extra free time you have. If you really want to get fancy, you can use a service like &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.ifttt.com&#39;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; to send important emails &amp;amp; receipts automagically to Evernote for safe-keeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need further help in setting up tags/folders or using IFTTT &amp;amp; Evernote with email? &lt;a href=&#39;mailto:james@jamescampbell.us&#39;&gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt; or send me a &lt;a href=&#39;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;text=%40jamescampbell+I+need+help+with+email+lets+talk&#39;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; to setup a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;further-reading:f39a381078bb4971d82526982b3ecc50&#34;&gt;Further reading:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikil Viswanathan has &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.nikilster.com/thoughts/how-to-win-at-email/?&#39;&gt;some ideas&lt;/a&gt; about how to manage your inbox but I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend his method because it relies too heavily on Google Lab features in Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Blog Tips has a &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.dailyblogtips.com/10-tips-for-managing-email-effectively/&#39;&gt;10 Tips to Manage Email&lt;/a&gt; but it pretty much repeats what I say plus throws in a few items on how to setup your signature block and other items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifehack.org has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/five-simple-yet-effective-tips-for-managing-your-email.html&#34;&gt;5 simple and effective tips&lt;/a&gt; where the author calls the times throughout the day to check email as &amp;lsquo;email hotspots&amp;rsquo; which sounds ridiculous to me and makes me think of wifi hotspots.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Creative Existence In The Digital Age</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/creative-existence-in-the-digital-age/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2012 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/creative-existence-in-the-digital-age/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My best works will never be shared on Facebook. They will never be tweeted and retweeted by the robotic hoard. They will never show up in the ever-growing free places to post digital works in exchange for digital ad space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes indeed, I feel more and more like unsharing. I also feel the need to dislike things I stumble upon while browsing the vast digital art landscape, but there is no dislike button. There is only &amp;lsquo;like&amp;rsquo; or silence. And my Internet silence is not golden. It is a brooding decaying wasteland of &amp;ldquo;look at me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;please follow me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;buy me.&amp;rdquo; It is a sick place where society shows off it&amp;rsquo;s twisted consumptive low-brow half-baked underbelly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want no part of it. But I cannot look away from kittens. Also, friends were wondering why I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would shut everything down if I could, but I realize this digital escapism, however noble it seems on its face, is doomed to failure much like the escapism of the last century. People packed up their RV&amp;rsquo;s, ran to their cabins in the woods, grew their own food, but when the illusion was over they still had to slog back to work after the holiday weekend to make money to live, and in turn perpetuate the holy lie for another generation. I am still slogging through this Internet wasteland hoping for the tiny glimpses of humanity I find from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this the golden future we were promised on the backs of the last century? Technology without humanity? Sleek Aluminium &amp;amp; glass without emotion? Multi-touch without human-touch? Self-affirmation and a voice on a personal blog but no longer a real connection to society? Snarky clever commentary behind a firewall of avatars instead of real discussion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should I do with my creations? I will send the most mundane of them to be consumed by the unnamable digitalis and I will keep my best works for myself, for my co-conspirators, cohorts, gallery representatives, limited edition books, friends, and family. I will post these works on my own walls of my own home with my own hands and remain human and true to myself. I will share a few of these things on my own site that I created on a server I coded myself. In this way, I will never lose my muse, and I will be free to do as I please. All the while I hold out hope for a dislike button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ironic thing is you will probably post this on Facebook and share it with all your internet friends. And then LOLCATZ will be the only suitable response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile Photographers Make Great Salesmen</title>
      <link>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Mobile-Photographers-Make-Great-Salesmen/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jamescampbell.us/post/Mobile-Photographers-Make-Great-Salesmen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For 3 months when I was 19 years old, I worked as a car salesman. I was probably one of the worst in Pennsylvania, if not the entire United States. I was one of three hires, and I didn’t know it then but the dealership was only going to keep one of us. This was all by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I naively thought that it would be easy, and that people would just say yes to me because I was a likeable guy. I offered everything to my customers, I threw in extras that my bosses would never agree to, losing many sales in the process. I over-sold the deal. When they let me go, I learned a valuable lesson: under-promise and over-deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make your clients happy is to follow this philosophy. For example, if you think a project will take a week, double the time period. Then when you finish early, everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So getting back to the title of this post, in my mind, this is what mobile photography has become, a giant game of lowering expectations to deliver something better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you visit a person’s exhibit (virtual or otherwise) who claims to be an ‘iphoneographer’ or ‘mobile photographer’, your expectations are lowered. After all, how good could photographs be from a mobile device? Thus, in your mind, the trap is set, the bar is lowered and you are ready to be dazzled. When you see the inevitable array of decent photographs, you will exclaim ‘Wow! I can’t believe these were taken with a mobile phone. These are really great, for an iPhone!”. The artist will feel good about the praise, but you probably won’t buy any of their works, because you realize what has happened and you can’t really take them seriously because you are thinking to yourself, ‘hmmm, I can probably do the same thing with my phone…’. ​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seriously trying to be an artist, be careful with the labels you choose. You may be setting the bar too low, and that ‘jaw drop’ effect will be far too easy to achieve. As an alternative, you can try setting the bar higher and really challenge yourself and your audience. Try not even labeling your works at all. Try focusing merely on the composition, the work itself. If you can achieve that same ‘WOW’ and ‘jaw-drop’ effect without the qualifier ‘for a mobile phone’ or ‘for a digital painting’ or ‘for an animated gif’ or any of the other phrases that qualify and undermine your creations, then you really have succeeded as an artist showcasing your art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should not be about the tool used, this is logically self-evident. So why would you choose to label yourself and associate yourself with the tool you use? If I take photos with only Nikon equipment, am I a Nikonographer? Or DSLRographer? Or filmographer? You can see how ridiculous this sounds. Unless I was sponsored by Nikon, I would never ever consider this as a proper label. Labels and logical taxonomies are only useful for specific instances, like contests and juried exhibitions, where the stakeholders want an even playing field and the sponsors want to push their products to the proper audience. The limitations that are set for certain exhibitions even help artists use their creativity within the constraints. This is all well and good, but outside of these specific instances, why would you constrain yourself and reduce your work to a specific category?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am expecting this to be misread as an affront to mobile photography, but I assure you, that was not my intent, I am only trying to communicate a complicated concept that has been floating around in my head, and this is hard to distill in a way that is easily understood by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I travel back to PA, I smile when I pass the old dealership, long since shutdown and left dilapidated on the side of the highway. I feel like somehow even though it was terrible at the time to be let go, if I would have stayed on as a car salesman at that place that would have been my fate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal should be do create things that make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destroy and otherwise ignore the things that don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never stop noticing the small things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never be too busy to be able to talk to a stranger about nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
